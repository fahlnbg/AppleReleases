## Contribution Process
1. Fork the project and make changes relevant to what you're trying to add/fix — do this in a seperate branch in your fork
2. Test your changes.
3. Create a Pull Request for your changes in your specific branch — include a description of the change and where you tested your change

Don't expect your changes to be merged and pushed to upstream immediately — your changes will be reviewed by [m1sta](https://github.com/m1stadev) or [Jaidan](https://github.com/ja1dan), providing suggested changes which must be met.

Once all further changes have been met (if any) and your changes are approved, they will be merged into upstream, with the bot being updated with your changes soon after.
